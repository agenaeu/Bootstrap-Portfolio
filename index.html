                <p> My name is Stephen Dillon Rice, however I've gone by Dillon my entire life. I'm 28 years old and have recently
                    finished my bachelors degree in general biology. I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field but
                    quickly realized that I could not afford to go, nor could I likely get in. Instead I turned my attention
                    towards programming. I've dabbled with programming in the past and thought it was pretty neat, being
                    able to create your own content. I figured the bootcamp would be a great place to start on a career in
                    it so I took the leap. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner. If i'm interested in something then it's
                    hard for me to not jump into the deep end.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Currently I work as a bartender and server at a local japanese restaurant called Kabuki. I've worked there for almost nine years. It is really the only job I've had as an adult.</p>
